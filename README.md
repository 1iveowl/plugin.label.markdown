## Why this plugin
Wouldn't it be cool if the Xamarin Label control supported (Markdown)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown]? 

And how cool would it be if it was possible to include bindable properties inside a Markdown text like this: `There are {{1}} apples in the basket.`, where {{1}} represents the bindable property? 

This plugin offers both!

## Platform support

The plugin works on all platforms supported by Xamarin Forms and .NET Standard 2.0.

## Markdown features supported:
- Headers - H1, H2 & H3
- Bold
- Italic
- Bold-Italic
- Hyperlinks
